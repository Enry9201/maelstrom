Mods &amp; modding tools for Final Fantasy VIII PC

## Maelstrom - open-world randomiser
* Shuffle the locations of bosses, GFs, draw points, and more
* Skip the story &amp; go anywhere in any order
* Current status: shuffles bosses with rudimentary rebalancing, shorter intro sequence, English version only

> Note: early alpha software!!
>
> The randomiser's effects are unstable and there is not yet any option to reverse them.
>
> To undo this you will need to repair/reinstall the game, or restore a backup of the data/lang-en folder.

## MiniMog - enemy AI editor
* View & edit battle scripts
* Current status: read-only output, working on making the scripting language more readable

None of this would have been possible without dozens of [QhimmWiki](https://wiki.ffrtt.ru/index.php/FF8) contributors and forum posters who are all a lot smarter than me!!
