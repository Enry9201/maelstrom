Mods &amp; modding tools for Final Fantasy VIII PC

## Maelstrom - open-world randomiser
* Shuffle the locations of bosses, GFs, draw points, and more
* Skip the story &amp; go anywhere in any order
* Current status:
  * Shuffled bosses with rudimentary rebalancing (some of them crash though, watch out)
  * Draw points give random spells, including Slots-exclusives if you're lucky
  * Shortened intro sequence - just name your characters &amp; get out
  * No mandatory story scenes up to the end of the Fire Cavern
  * Fixed seed option
  * Pre-fill character/GF names
  * Run with all the boxes unchecked to reset everything
  * Works with English Steam version only

> Note: early alpha software!!
>
> The randomiser is unfinished & its effects are unstable. You won't finish a full game of this!
>
> Don't be surprised if you have to repair your install at some point.

## MiniMog - enemy AI editor
